TASK: Develop a custom type (class) "ORDINARY FRACTIONS". The source code of the class should be formatted as two files: a header file with a class declaration and a method implementation file. The fraction is stored in "canonical form": if n is the numerator and d is the denominator, then the sign is stored in the numerator (the denominator is always greater than 0), and n and d are mutually prime. Implement all possible arithmetic operators on fractions, comparison, increment and decrement operators, unary minus, negation operator overload, as an operator for obtaining the inverse fraction, input from the stream, output to the stream, conversion to a real type, assignment operator, compound assignment operators. To handle exceptional situations, use your own class (the simplest option is possible).
To demonstrate the capabilities of a class, write a head program in which to demonstrate working with this class. There is no need to make a menu. In the comments, indicate what you are testing.
